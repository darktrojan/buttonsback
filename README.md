I'm not uploading 'releases' any more due to GitHub restricting what file types I can add.

**Firefox 29 and 30 users, you want the `firefox30` branch.**

To get this repo in your Firefox profile, clone it into your extensions directory as `buttonsback@darktrojan.net` and start Firefox.

```
cd [your profile dir]/extensions
git clone git://github.com/darktrojan/buttonsback.git buttonsback@darktrojan.net
```

Otherwise, go to the releases page, download a .zip, unzip it, enter the directory inside and rezip its contents (confusing instructions, yay!). Rename it to have a `.xpi` extension, then add to Firefox.
