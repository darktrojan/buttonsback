I'm not uploading 'releases' any more due to GitHub restricting what file types I can add.

To get this repo in your Firefox profile, clone it into your extensions directory as buttonsback@darktrojan.net and start Firefox.

cd [your profile dir]/extensions
git clone git://github.com/darktrojan/buttonsback.git buttonsback@darktrojan.net

Otherwise, go to the releases page, download a .zip, unzip it, enter the directory inside and rezip its contents (confusing instructions, yay!). Rename it to have a `.xpi` extension, then add to Firefox.
